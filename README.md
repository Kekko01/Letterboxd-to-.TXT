## How to do

1. Go to https://letterboxd.com/user/exportdata to export your data from Letterboxd

2. Unzip the .zip file you just downloaded and take the diary.csv file and move this file to a new folder (for example movies)

3. Download the script from https://github.com/Kekko01/Letterboxd-to-.TXT/blob/main/main.py

4. Move the main.py file to the folder you just created.

5. If you don't have it, download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it. Otherwise, skip this step.

6. Just run the main.py file, it will create a films.txt file with the movie list

Terminal text:

```bash
    python main.py
```
